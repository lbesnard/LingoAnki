## About This Script

This script converts your personal diary entries into powerful language learning materials:

- 📇 **Anki flashcards** to reinforce vocabulary and sentence structure through spaced repetition
- 🎧 **MP3 lessons using TPRS** (Teaching Proficiency Through Reading and Storytelling), a highly effective and natural method for language acquisition

---

## Why This Approach?

Most language learning resources teach you someone else's vocabulary. The result? You struggle to express yourself — because you're not learning the words that matter **to you**.

By writing a diary, you're telling **your own story**, using **your own vocabulary**. This makes the learning process more relevant, personal, and effective. Each diary entry is then transformed into a TPRS-style lesson — tailored to your life.

> ✨ We use **OpenAI** to:
>
> - Translate your diary entries into the study language
> - Generate helpful tips to understand the translation
> - Create **Q&A prompts** in TPRS style for each sentence

TPRS is a proven method that emphasises storytelling, repetition, and comprehension questions. Unfortunately, for many languages, high-quality TPRS resources are hard to find. This script fills that gap by letting you create your own.

## How to Use the MP3 Lessons

Listen to each audio file **repeatedly** — 20 times is not an exaggeration. The goal is to reach the point where you **respond without thinking**.

As you progress, so will your diary entries. They'll naturally become more complex.

> ✍️ **Tip**: Start with **very simple sentences** — it's better to master the basics before adding complexity.

---

This script empowers you to build your fluency one story at a time — your story.

## Example

Below is an example of a diary entry to learn Norwegian:

## usage

Copy the [Config file example](lingoanki/config.yaml) into `~/.config/lingoDiary/config.yaml`
An OpenAi API is required to translate and create TPRS style Q&A.

```bash
lingoDiary  # will automatically prompt the user for new entries
```

# lingoAnki

This script automates the creation of Anki flashcards from transcripts extracted from audio recordings. It processes
both individual words and sentences, generating transcriptions and translations, and attaching audio to each flashcard.

Features:

- Uses Whisper for transcription and Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) for generating audio.
- Translates words and sentences using GoogleTranslator or ChatGptTranslator.
- Organizes flashcards into two Anki subdecks: one for words and one for sentences.
- Supports multiple languages.

## When to use

It is especially useful to convert Audio lessons, for example converting all the
audio files from an Assimil course into flashcards. This script is mainly
intended for this

But one could use this script as well to convert podcasts.
